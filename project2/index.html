    <h4>DISCOVER THE AUTHENTIC FLAVORS OF CHINESE CUISINE FOODS</h4>
    <p style="color:black;font-family: fantasy;">Chinese cuisine is one of the world's oldest and most diverse cuisines, comprising foods originating from China. Chinese meals include four main food groups â€” fruits, vegetables, grains and meat. These dishes don't contain large amounts of dairy.</p>

 <p style="color:black;font-family: fantasy;">The theory of balancing fan (grains and rice) with cai (vegetables and meat) is one of the factors that distinguish Chinese cuisine from that of other countries. This refined proportion of harmony and symmetry of ingredients was practiced whenever possible in households throughout the ages and is not limited to formal or high cuisine or to meals served on special occasions.

    In addition to taste that pleases, astrological, geographical, and personal characteristics had to satisfy the complex system of the yin-yang balance of hot and cold, based on Daoist perception of the cosmic equilibrium. According to this theory, every foodstuff possesses an inherent humour; thus, consuming foods and beverages at proper and complementary temperatures can adjust the possible deviation of the normal state of the two intertwining forces.</p>
